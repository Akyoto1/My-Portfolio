      Hello, my name is Amber Chambers. I am a student at Humber College, and
      I'm enrolled in the Computer Programming & Analysis Program. <br /><br />

      I started taking Computer Programming because I found that I was gaining
      an interest in coding. I did take some courses here and there but decided
      to jump into programming as I wanted a structured way to learn how to
      code. <br /><br />

      Besides coding I do enjoy gaming, reading and trying new things with my
      family and friends.
