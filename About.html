      Hello, my name is Amber Chambers. I am a student at Humber College, and
      I'm enrolled in the Computer Programming & Analysis Program. <br /><br />

      I started taking Computer Programming because I found that I was gaining
      an interest in coding. I did take some courses here and there but
      eventually decided to take the Computer Programming & Analysis Program as
      I wanted a structured way to learn how to code. <br /><br />

      Some of my favorite languiages are HTML, CSS, SQL and PYTHON Besides
      coding I do enjoy gaming, reading, cooking and trying new things with my
      family and friends.
